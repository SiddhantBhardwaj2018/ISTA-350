The data in the 5 children are the 5 denomination strings (i.e. `'5'`, `'10'`, etc.), respectively.  The children have no children of their own.  If a filename was passed in, each line of the file will represent a bill that we want to add to our watch list tree and will be in the format `'<serial_number> <denomination>\\n'`.  Look at one of the bill files in a text editor to see specific examples.  Insert each of the bills into the watch list.
